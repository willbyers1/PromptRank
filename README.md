## 📖 Overview
PromptRank is a serverless educational tool that analyzes and grades the quality of text prompts for LLMs. Built with a stunning **Cyberpunk/Dark Mode** aesthetic, it utilizes advanced **Regular Expressions (Regex)** to evaluate inputs based on five critical dimensions: *Length, Persona, Output Clarity, Chain of Thought, and Few-Shot examples.*

The application features a **"Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK)** architecture simulation to mimic real-world SaaS security environments while keeping all logic strictly client-side.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🧠 Smart Scoring Algorithm:** A JavaScript-based engine that calculates a quality score (0-100) based on proven prompt engineering techniques.
* **🔐 BYOK Security Gate:** Implements a strict overlay that prevents access until an API Key (simulated or real) is provided, storing it safely in `Session Storage`.
* **📊 Visual Feedback Loop:** Features an animated circular gauge and color-coded progress bars (Red/Orange/Green) to represent prompt health visually.
* **⚡ Real-Time Analysis:** Instantly checks for "Act as", "Step by step", output formats (JSON/Markdown), and more.
* **🎨 Cyberpunk UI:** Deep blacks (#0f172a), neon purples, and vibrant greens create an immersive coding environment.
* **📱 Fully Responsive:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices using a modern stacked layout.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Core Framework:** Vue.js 3 (via CDN)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
* **Logic:** Pure JavaScript (ES6+) & Regex
* **Architecture:** Single File Component (HTML5)

    ```

## 🎮 Usage

1.  **Authenticate:** Enter any API Key (e.g., `sk-proj...`) to unlock the interface.
2.  **Draft:** Type your prompt into the main text area.
3.  **Analyze:** Click the **"Analyze Prompt"** button.
4.  **Review:** Check your score on the gauge and review the checklist to see missing elements (e.g., "Add a Persona").
5.  **Refine:** Edit your prompt based on the feedback to hit a perfect 100/100.

## 🛡️ Privacy Note
PromptRank operates entirely on the **client-side**. Your API keys and prompt texts are processed within your browser's memory and are never transmitted to any external server.
